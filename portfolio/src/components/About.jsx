      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>Hey there! I'm Gift, your friendly neighborhood tech enthusiast and a senior IT student at North-West University. With a major in Computer Information Technology, I'm on a quest to conquer the world of Full Stack development, one line of code at a time! ðŸŽ‰ I'm expected to graduate in 2026, and I'm excited to turn my passion into a thriving career.</p>
      <p>My journey in tech is fueled by curiosity and creativity. I've dabbled in a variety of programming languages, including Java, C++, C#, JavaScript, and HTML5. I thrive in development environments like Microsoft Visual Studio and Oracle SQL Developer, where I get to transform ideas into robust software solutions.</p>
      
      <h3>Full Stack Developer Extraordinaire</h3>
      <p>What really gets me pumped is Full Stack development! I love crafting seamless web experiences, utilizing a blend of front-end and back-end technologies. Whether it's whipping up dynamic user interfaces with JavaScript and CSS or architecting powerful back-end systems with ASP.NET, I'm all about building applications that are not only functional but also fun to use.</p>
      <p>One of my proudest projects is the Tutoring App and Management System, where I designed a sleek database architecture to track student and tutor information effortlessly. I took on the challenge of ensuring efficient data collection and retrieval, all while keeping the user experience at the forefront. Who said coding can't be exciting?</p>
